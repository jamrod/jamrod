### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm James!
I'm a software Engineer in the Denver/Boulder bubble.
I have been working with HTML, CSS and Javascript for a few years and at the end of 2019 got a huge skills boost by attending General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program.
Since then I've been building websites and serverless apps on AWS and trying to improve my Python game.
